Homework 4 - Problem Set

8.4
Prove that the number of binary palindromes of length 2k+ 1 (odd length) is 2^k+1
for all k ≥ 0.

Proof: Let P(n) be the statement "2^k+1." We want to prove that P(k) is true for all k ≥ 0
Base Case: Since 2^0+1 is equal to two, which is greater than 0, P(0) is clearly true. //have to assume smallest number.
Hypothesis: Assuming that p(k) is true, there are 2^k+1 binary palindromes of length 2k+1
Inductive:
Assume that P(K) is true for any number greater than zero.
    If k = 0, then there are two binary palindromes of length 1, either 0 or 1.
    If k = 1, then there are four binary palinromes of length 2, 00, 01, 10, 11.
Summary: Through the maxim of modus ponens, we are able to confidently say that this rule follows for k+1.
