Homework 4 - Problem Set

8.4
Prove that the number of binary palindromes of length 2k+ 1 (odd length) is 2^k+1
for all k â‰¥ 0.

Base Case: Since 2^0+1 is equal to two, which is greater than 0, P(0) is clearly true. //have to assume smallest number.
Hypothesis: Assuming that p(k) is true, there are 2^k+1 binary palindromes of length 2k+1
Inductive:
Assume that P(K) is true for any number greater than zero.
    If k = 0, then there are two binary palindromes of length 1, either 0 or 1.
    If k = 1, then there are four binary palinromes of length 2, 00, 01, 10, 11.
 Through the maxim of modus ponens, we are able to confidently say that this rule follows for k+1.

a. if n > 0, f(n) = 1 + n/2. Otherwise, f(n) = 0

b.
Base Case: We assume that N = 0, which returns N < 0.
Hypothesis: We then assume that n > 0
Inductive: n > 0 returns f(n) = 1 + n/2

c.
This complexity for halfIt(n) would be Cost(N) = Cost (N) + C which means O(N)
