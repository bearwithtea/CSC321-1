Prove that the number of binary palindromes of length 2k+ 1 (odd length) is 2^(k+1) for all k â‰¥ 0.

Base Case: Since 2^(0+1) is equal to two, this matches all possibilities for all 1 bit palindromes.
Hypothesis: Assuming that p(k) is true, there are 2^(k+1) binary palindromes of length 2k+1
Inductive:
Assume this statement is true for all k < K
    2^(K+1)
    2^(K-1) + 1
    2^K * 2
    2^k+1

 Through the maxim of modus ponens, we are able to confidently say that this
 rule follows for k+1.

a. if n > 0, f(n) = 1 + n/2. Otherwise, f(n) = 0

b.
Base Case: We assume that N = 0, which returns N < 0.
Hypothesis: We then assume that n > 0
Inductive: n > 0 returns f(n) = 1 + n/2

c.
This complexity for halfIt(n) would be Cost(N) = Cost (N) + C which means O(N)

Assuming the priests can move one disk per second, that they started moving
disks 6000 years ago, and that the legend of the Towers of Hanoi is true, when will the world end?
